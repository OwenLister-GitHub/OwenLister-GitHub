**Hi, I’m Owen Lister. Currently, the only files in my GitHub repository are all of the scripts that I wrote/created in C#, within Unity to create a 2D pixel, 
singleplayer, platformer video game.**

This video game was my A-Level computer science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment) project which also involved lots of documentation
of any errors or problems I encountered while developing the game, design decisions I made for usability, stakeholder requirements and their involvement in the 
development, tesing and evaluation phases, success criteria for my game (so I could measure my success and break down my game into the most significant parts) and
some other elements of documentation.

Thank you for looking at my repository
